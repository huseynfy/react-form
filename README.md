# Welcome, 👋🏼❕

This form submission project was created and developed by me using React JS.
-https://distracted-wright-d26f57.netlify.app/

## Description ℹ️
This is a basic form for getting necessary information about a user. Users are not allowed to click submit button until every input is fulfilled. After successful submission, a user gets success message. Occupation and state data are coming from an endpoint and users are allowed to select only one option.

## React Hooks 🪝
I used useState and useEffect hooks as well as my own custom hook in this app.


## Available Scripts 💻

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
